This project is part of the curriculum of the Full-Stack Web Development program at [Hamburg Coding School](https://hamburgcodingschool.com/).

## Goal

Goal is to transfer the main idea from your last [project "The Travel Blog"](https://github.com/hamburgcodingschool/javascript-for-web-2020-03/blob/master/PROJECT.md),
made with pure Javascript, HTML and CSS into a **React App**.

While working on the project remind yourself of *"thinking in components"*, – one of the many great parts of React.

### now Bonus: 6. New Blog Post

- [x] With the path `/new` a blog post form is shown, where a new blog post can be added.
- [x] On submit, the new blog post is sent and stored to Firestore.

  You can use the history hook provided by the React Router: `useHistory()`.

  ```
  import { useHistory } from "react-router-dom";

  function HomeButton() {
    let history = useHistory();

    function handleClick() {
      history.push("/home");
    }

    return (
      <button type="button" onClick={handleClick}>
        Go home
      </button>
    );
  }
  ```
  You can read more about, how changing a route programmatically, here:

  - https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/history

- [ ] For the images: Save the image in your project manually in the public folder and use it with relative path as string.  
  For instance: The image `barcelona.jpg` saved under `public/images` can be linked in the templates with `"/images/barcelona.jpg"`.

## Submission

1. Upload your code to a new GitHub repository.
  - If you placed your API keys directly into your code, remember to remove your API keys.

    **Hint:**
    There is a way to use keys in the React project without the risk to push those to a repository accidentally:
      - Add a file `.env` into your project root folder. It is ignored by git.
      - In this file you can define custom environment variables like that: `REACT_APP_MY_API_KEY=MyKey-12345`
      - Within your component you can use it with `{process.env.REACT_APP_MY_API_KEY}`
      - After every change in this files you have to restart your project.

      For more information check out: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/.

  - [x] If you worked in a team, link the GitHub accounts of both of you in the README.md.

2. Send us an email with the following information:
  - A link to your GitHub repository
  - Your firebase configuration and
  - Please create a guest user account in firebase for us which we can use to log in to your travel blog app. Send us the credentials (email + password) for this guest login.
  - If you worked in a team, both your names
  - If you did any bonus tasks, list them
  - Send it to Mary (mary@hamburgcodingschool.com) and Teresa (teresa@hamburgcodingschool.com)
